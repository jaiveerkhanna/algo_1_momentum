# algo_1_momentum
My first long-only momentum based trading algorithm. Written in Python

The Jupyter Notebooks are pretty self explanatory and have most of my thought process written down. The Backtester will walk you through data download, cleaning, analysis, as well as backtesting/portfolio opimization. After all of this, a final 2 tests were conducted using out of sample data.

The IB Implementation samples code that interacts with Interactive Brokers through the Trader Workstation in order to execute live trades and implement my strategy in real time.
